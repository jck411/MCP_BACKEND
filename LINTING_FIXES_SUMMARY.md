# Linting Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Config.py - Too Many Branches (PLR0912)
**Location:** `get_context_config` method (line 217)
**Problem:** Method had 13 branches (limit: 12)

**Solution:** Refactored the method into smaller, focused helper methods:
- `get_context_config()` - Main orchestration method (reduced to 2 branches)
- `_validate_context_config_structure()` - Validates required configuration sections exist
- `_build_context_config_dict()` - Builds and returns the configuration dictionary
- `_validate_context_config_values()` - Validates configuration value ranges and relationships

**Benefits:**
- Each method has a single responsibility
- Easier to test individual validation logic  
- Improved readability and maintainability
- Reduced cognitive complexity

### 2. WebSocket Server - Too Many Branches (PLR0912) and Too Many Statements (PLR0915)
**Location:** `start_server` method (line 414)
**Problems:** 
- 14 branches (limit: 12)
- 54 statements (limit: 50)

**Solution:** Extracted the large method into smaller, focused methods:
- `start_server()` - Main orchestration method (reduced to 4 branches, 12 statements)
- `_get_server_config()` - Extract and validate server configuration
- `_create_uvicorn_server()` - Create uvicorn server instance
- `_run_server_with_monitoring()` - Handle server execution with optional monitoring
- `_run_with_shutdown_monitoring()` - Handle shutdown event monitoring
- `_handle_graceful_shutdown()` - Handle graceful shutdown process
- `_handle_server_completion()` - Handle server completion scenarios
- `_cleanup_server_resources()` - Clean up resources during shutdown

**Benefits:**
- Each method has a clear, single purpose
- Easier to test individual server lifecycle phases
- Improved error handling granularity
- Better separation of concerns
- Reduced complexity in main method

## Code Quality Improvements

### Method Extraction Pattern
Both fixes follow the same pattern:
1. **Identify complex logic blocks** within large methods
2. **Extract logical chunks** into private helper methods
3. **Maintain the same public interface** for backward compatibility
4. **Improve testability** by creating focused, testable units

### Error Handling
- Preserved all original error handling behavior
- Improved error context by having focused validation methods
- Maintained explicit configuration requirements

### Maintainability
- Code is now easier to modify and extend
- Each method has a clear responsibility
- Reduced cognitive load for developers reading the code

## Testing
- All functionality tested and confirmed working
- Server startup behavior unchanged
- Configuration validation still enforces explicit requirements
- No breaking changes to public APIs

## Impact
- ✅ All Ruff linting errors resolved
- ✅ Code complexity significantly reduced
- ✅ Maintainability improved
- ✅ No functional changes or breaking changes
- ✅ Explicit configuration requirements maintained
